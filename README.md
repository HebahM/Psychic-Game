# Psychic-Game

In this game, the computer thinks of a letter which the user must guess.
The user has nine attempts to guess the correct letter. 
If the user guesses correctly within nine attempts, they win the round and the game resets. 
If they don't guess correctly, they lose the round and the game will reset.
